PAXL provides designers and engineers the foundation they need to deliver new product features quickly, while also delivering a consistent UX and brand experience to Premier Agent’s users. This past summer I joined the Premier Agent UX team as a UX Engineer intern and was given the challenge to contribute a new datepicker component for Premier Agent’s design system.",
